 * \param function
 *        Pointer to the task entry function
 * \param parameters
 *        Pointer to memory that will be used as a parameter for the task being
 *        created. This memory should not typically come from stack, but rather
 *        from dynamically (i.e., malloc'd) or statically allocated memory.
 * \param prio
 *        The priority at which the task should run.
 *        TASK_PRIO_DEFAULT plus/minus 1 or 2 is typically used.
 * \param stack_depth
 *        The number of words (i.e. 4 * stack_depth) available on the task's
 *        stack. TASK_STACK_DEPTH_DEFAULT is typically sufficienct.
 * \param name
 *        A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to facilitate
 *        debugging. The name may be up to 32 characters long.
 *
 * \return A handle by which the newly created task can be referenced. If an
 * error occurred, NULL will be returned and errno can be checked for hints as
 * to why task_create failed.
